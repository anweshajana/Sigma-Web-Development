**Components of HTML are:**
1. Client side (Front-end): Runs in the user’s browser, handling the interface, input, and interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Browser:  Software (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) that retrieves web pages, executes client-side code, and displays content.
3. Server Side (Back-end): Runs on the web server, handling data, security, authentication, and heavy processing using languages like Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, or Java.
4. Relationship: The browser executes client-side code, which communicates with the server-side for data or actions. The server responds, and the browser renders the result for the user.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Backend:**
The backend is the server side of the website.
It stores and arranges data, also makes sure that everything on the client side works fine.
It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
It is the portion of software that doesn’t come in direct contact with the users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Frontend of a website is created using 3 languages:**
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascade Style Sheet)
3. JavaScript

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**To Preview the Website in mobile phone also:**
Open Terminal → ipconfig (command) → copy IPv4 address → open VS Code → Settings → live preview → change the local IP address with the IPv4 address → make sure the Wi-Fi is turned on to private network → now restart VS Code → type the IPv4 address and port number in the mobile phone browser (you can now see the website in the mobile phone)
