**Components of HTML are:**
1. Client side
2. Browser
3. Server Side

**Backend:**
The backend is the server side of the website.
It stores and arranges data, also makes sure that everything on the client side works fine.
It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
It is the portion of software that doesnâ€™t come in direct contact with the users.
